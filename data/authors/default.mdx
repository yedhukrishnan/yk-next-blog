I am a software developer who predominantly works with Ruby on Rails and Next.js. I have experience building multi-tenant, e-commerce applications, data pipelines, machine learning prediction models, Chrome extensions, image processing algorithms, and Android applications.

My areas of interests mainly revolves around writing and maintaining code. I spent my time learning machine learning algorithms, reading about software development methodologies , and writing (better than before) code.

I like to blog. In fact, I like to create multiple blogs. Here is a link to my previous blog homepage: [Yedhu Krishnan](http://yedhukrishnan.github.io). This one links to all my previous posts and blogs. Here is a [timeline](http://yedhukrishnan.github.io/timeline.html) of my career.
