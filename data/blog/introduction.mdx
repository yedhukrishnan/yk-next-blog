summary: A TensorFlow tool to visualize neural networks
---

I would like to start with a wonderful tool I came across. This is called [TensorFlow Deep Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). In short, this tool helps you visualize neural networks. You need some understanding of the neural networks to understand how this works.

You can select from the list of datasets available on the playground. The app lets you tweak activation functions, number of layers and neurons, noise in the dataset, inputs and many more. You can visualize the training on the playground itself, and make necessary adjustments until you get a better model to fit the data.

Give it a try. As mentioned on the website, this is open source, and you can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground). It helps you quickly try different approaches without writing code, which is quite cool!

Here is something I was trying: [My Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&batchSize=10&dataset=spiral&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=5,5,5&seed=0.36529&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=true&ySquared=true&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false). If you have any suggestions to improve this, please let me know.
